# Sleep Duration Among High School Students
## Machine learning (ML) for Predicting sleeping hours

### Background
Insufficient sleep among children and adolescents is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, injuries, poor mental health, attention and behavior problems, and poor academic performance.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has recommended that, for optimal health, teens aged 13–18 years should sleep 8–10 hours per 24 hours. Thus, those who sleep less than 8 hours are considered having short sleep duration problem.
In the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a question about sleep duration in the questionnaire was answered by high school students in 38 states. 

### Instructions
Seven prectors, including drinking habits, eating habits, playing with computers, smoking, violence, gender, and race were chosen to analyze their relationship with one response variable (sleep duration per school night). Five ML models were used to analyze the dataset: linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and tree models. Then, we applied 3-fold cross validation and variable selection approaches (backward, forward, and stepwise selection, and regularization regression methods (bagging, random forest, and boosting) to verify and fine-tune ML models. 

* #### Step 1: load the dataset
