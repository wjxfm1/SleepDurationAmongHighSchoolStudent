## Machine learning (ML) for Predicting sleeping hours


### Background
### Insufficient sleep among children and adolescents is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, injuries, poor mental health, attention and behavior

#### It may look a little bit messy, but this is the way I tried that reminds me to think differently.
